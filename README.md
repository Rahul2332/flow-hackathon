## About The Project

### Inspiration

With the world rapidly accepting and appreciating blockchain and decentralised ecosystems, it is imperative that major financial instruments such as Stock Exchange Market migrate to WEB3. New firms will be built on WEB3, and blockchain token transactions will be a major element of monetary transactions in the near future.
Moreover Payments, loans, and borrowing were formerly only available through established financial institutions including banks. However, things changed with the arrival of blockchain technology. When the notion of cryptocurrencies began to grow in popularity, the conversation switched to a new set of issues, namely, decentralised finance (DeFi) Decentralized finance fosters an equitable and transparent financial system in which anybody may participate. It uses blockchain technology to provide unbanked individuals with access to financial and banking services.

While the Flow blockchain is gaining traction as a platform for building DeFi applications, it is still relatively new and AngelFLow will boost up the Defi Ecosystem on Flow. As a result, having a platform like AngelFlow is essential for Flow.

### Introduction

The Flow blockchain has emerged as a popular platform for creating DeFi applications, and one such application is our Angel-Flow platform that offers various investment options. Our platform brings Stock Exchange Market on Chain. This platform enables users to invest in a range of assets, including tokens representing stocks of companies, liquidity pools, and staking pools. By leveraging the decentralized and transparent nature of blockchain technology, this application provides users with secure and efficient investment opportunities that can potentially yield significant returns.

### Features

<img src='assets/workflow-devilslist.png'>
AngelFlow is a fully-decentralised app where investors can invest in stocks, liquidity pool, stacking pool etc.

### Exclusive Features

#### DevilsList Marketplace

Our goal was to develop a single, all-encompassing blockchain application that would allow users to invest, raise money, monitor cash flow, and more. DevilsList is a one-stop shop for all of your requirements, as my friends have very clearly explained. But as we worked to establish this product, we came to the realisation that, despite our best efforts to link investors and entrepreneurs, it is inevitable that startups will have to give up some equity in order to receive funding. What if we could devise a different means of obtaining funding for such startups? Thus, we developed the concept for DevilList Marketplace.

<img src='assets/market-place-working.png'>

Every company that registers on DevilList will receive a set of FA2 Fungible Company Tokens. These tokens are comparable to shares, however they are exclusively available on DevilList . The number of company tokens each founder and member wants to possess as a member must be entered whenever the firm registers itself and they are added as we have seen previously. The entire number of tokens that the company owns is determined when all members have been added, and the initial token price is set to the company's total valuation divided by the total token. These tokens can now be traded on the DevilList Market Place like shares. Anyone who wants to buy this token can log in to DevilMarket Place and submit a buy request.

Unlike with regular shares, the seller of this token will continue to receive 5% of any trade profits made by subsequent buyers of this token. Therefore, after 20 successful trades involving these tokens, they will no longer exist. As is obvious, the sooner you become the token's owner, the more and longer you can earn.
As a result, the majority of people will purchase these tokens from firm members as quickly as possible, helping to finance the startup in its early stages.
Also the subsequent buyers, analyse company's valuation and trade this token similar to regular trading with 5% Royalty going to company. This will assist in ensuring a steady flow of funding for the business.

#### Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Chat Application

Most platforms offer only a global or general chating service on decentralized applications but on Devilslist decentralized peer-to-peer communication is possible. This one on one chatting service provides a more personalized experience to the investors and the companies to negotiate in investements.

## Why Flow

## Challenges Faced

We are new to the Tezos Block chain are so we ran into soem issues while the duration of this project,

1. It took major time to resolve erros in smartpy due to lack of proper error messages and documentation regarding the errors.
2. The Becon Wallet was not compatible with the latest React JS version (18) due to which we had to use version 16.
3. The resources for the working of Angellist were scarce.

### Major issues

2 days prior to the deadline, the infura ipfs service stopped working due to which we had to switch to a different service
(nft.storage). This caused a major backlash due to which we had to restructure the project accordingly. If not for this
inconvenience we would have implemented more features we had initially decided.

## Future Aspects and Scope

Staking Pools:
Staking pool allows investors to earn a passive income on their cryptocurrency holdings by staking them on the blockchain. It is low-risk investment option compared to other investment options in the crypto space. By staking their cryptocurrency holdings in a pool, investors will actively contribute to the security and stability of the blockchain, which can help to promote the long-term growth and success of the ecosystem.

Crypto Exchanges : Crypto exchanges offer access to a wide variety of cryptocurrencies and tokens, which can provide investors with greater diversification in their portfolios. Crypto exchanges often offer access to new investment opportunities such as initial coin offerings (ICOs) and new token launches.Provides investors with the opportunity to generate substantial returns on their investments.

Expansion of investment options: As the DeFi ecosystem on the Flow blockchain grows, the AngelFlow platform could expand its investment options to include new types of investments such as cryptocurrency trading, ICOs, and NFTs. This could provide users with more opportunities to generate returns and attract new investors to the platform.

## Guide to setup the project locally

### Prerequisites

- Node v12.x +

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">Top</a></p>

### Setup, Run, Compile & Deploy Steps :

1.  `npm install` it will install all your dependencies

2.  `npm run client-install` it will install all the client dependencies i.e in React

> If step 2 does not work then go to the 'client' directory and run 'npm install'

3.  `npm run sync` this is a syncing command. Whenever the compile_config is changed in config.json this command must be executed from the terminal. This command helps the bundle to reconfigure the compilation parameters according to the changes you have made.

4.  `npm run compile` will build the contracts locally inside the folder ./contract_build. This command compiles the python file to a Michelson file and stores it in the ./contract_build folder.

5.  `npm run deploy` will deploy your contract with the params respect to your config.json

6.  `npm run dapp` It will spin-up the Dapp front-end and you are ready to use it. This Bundle is packed up with simple create-react-app. Once you run the command the front-end dev server will start up and you will be redirected to your home page in your default browser.

7.  `npm run test` It will run the whole template of SmartPy code with their scenario based testing. And the test results will be visualised in the teminal.

    > Step 7 will also generate a test_build where your test results will be stored.

8.  `npm run get-entry-points` It will extract the entry-points from you recently compiled code and display in the terminal with a sample invocation which you can reference while invoking an entry-point from your dapp.
9.  _`npm run sync` is mandatory whenever your config.json file is changed !_
